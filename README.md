# Vectorized Backtesting

Just after the title, introduce your project by describing attractively what the project is about and what is the main problem that inspires you to create this project or what is the main contribution for the potential user of your project.

## Overview of the Backtest

## Baseline Results

A Support Vector Machine with default settings for the hyperparameters was used to establish a baseline for model performance. The model was trained with a fast SMA of 4 and a slow SMA of 4 100, respectively as features, and a binary target indicating whether returns were positive or negative based on the features from the prior period.  

The baseline accuracy was 55%, just barely better than random. The chart below reflects this. The strategy returns mirror the shape of the actual returns, and are only slightly better.
